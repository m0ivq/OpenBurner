# OpenBurner
Alternative controller for Chinese diesel heaters using "blue wire" communication, based around the TTGO T-Display ESP32 board.

The idea is to use as many readily available components as possible, allowing you to build one yourself.

This project started after the popular 'Afterburner' controller became dificult to obtain in the UK and before I had a chance to make my own, the source code repository was made private. This is not a fork of the Afterburner project and is in no way trying to compete with it. You won't find all of the features in this controller as I don't need all of the features myself. However, if you want to add to the project, feel free to send a pull request.

I have no intention of selling ready made units but if you feel you wish to profit from this work, by all means go ahead but please stick to the GPL v3 licence and provide your customers with a copy of the licence!

If you choose to use this code, you do so at your own risk so don't hold me resposible if your house/van/car/boat/shed/garage/<other> burns down while using the OpenBurner!

If you manage to buy a ready-made unit from elsewhere, don't expect any support from me! I will however do my best to support people building their own units for personal use.
